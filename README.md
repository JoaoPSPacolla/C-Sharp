# 🖥️ C# Desktop Application Studies

This repository contains various exercises and class projects developed during my technical course in **Systems Development**. The code here represents my first steps with the **C# language** and the **Visual Studio** development environment.

## 💡 What I Learned

Throughout these studies, I worked with:

- MDI Forms and UI components in Windows Forms
- Basic event handling and application logic
- File and data manipulation
- Some SQL Server interaction for local database testing
- Core principles of building desktop applications

These exercises helped me understand how to structure a desktop application, manage user interaction, and integrate simple data handling logic.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Visual Studio
- Windows Forms (MDI)
- SQL Server (basic queries and integration)
